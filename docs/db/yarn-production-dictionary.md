# Yarn Production DB Dictionary

This dictionary is a concise review aid for the current Yarn Production DBML. The model is hybrid, but primarily record-centered: it preserves the business records used in Hilatura without inventing a production run, machine-shift context, lot aggregate, or lot timeline.

## Review focus

- Continuity is by section, machine, shift, business date, and yarn count.
- Production before Madejeras is recorded as discharges; Madejeras is recorded separately as skein output.
- Progress, process quality, and waste stay as their own record families.
- Current business records can be corrected, but correction history is stored separately.
- No SQL, indexing, ORM mapping, or reporting aggregate is defined here.
