# Batch Processing DB Dictionary

This dictionary is a concise review aid for the current Batch Processing DBML. Warehouse defines the single lot identity; each stage records only the facts it owns or verifies for that same lot.

## Review focus

- Every stage table references the Warehouse-defined `production_identity_id` directly.
- Stage records are separate because Inventory, Dyeing, Drying, Winding/Balling, Bagging, and Quality capture different business facts.
- Each table may contain multiple records for the same lot. The lot's process history is the axis: `business_date`, `shift_code`, actors, and timestamps describe an intervention and are never a uniqueness key.
- Later stages require completion of the prior stage. This is a use-case/domain invariant across specialized tables, enforced by application logic rather than cross-table DBML constraints.
- Notes are optional fields inside the relevant stage records, not a standalone table.
- Waste is not generalized. It stays on Winding/Balling and Bagging, where the current process clearly records conversion or packing waste.
- Quality Send evidence and an optional Warehouse pending-receipt note stay in `lot_quality_records`. `quality_sent_to_warehouse_at` is the singular explicit send marker: at most one Quality record per `production_identity_id` may set it. PostgreSQL must enforce this with `CREATE UNIQUE INDEX lot_quality_records_one_quality_send_per_lot_idx ON lot_quality_records (production_identity_id) WHERE quality_sent_to_warehouse_at IS NOT NULL`; DBML cannot express a partial unique index. The sent handoff is pending until Warehouse records its one `finished_product_receipts` row for the same `production_identity_id`; that receipt's unique `production_identity_id` rejects a second acceptance. No timestamp ordering or tie-breaker selects a handoff.
- Current business records can be corrected, but correction history is stored separately and lean.
- No SQL, indexing, ORM mapping, or reporting aggregate is defined here.

## Tables

### Lot identity

Warehouse owns the single `production_identity_id` and its visible `lot_code`; Lot Processing stores neither a duplicate aggregate nor duplicated defining fields.

Warehouse's initial definition of this identity preserves the business meaning formerly expressed by `warehouse_defined`; it is not a Lot Processing state.


### `inventory_stage_records`

Represents the physical assembly of the lot by Inventory.

### `lot_quality_records`

Represents final Quality inspection, the one permitted Quality Send marker, and any Warehouse coordination note while the lot awaits Warehouse validation. Warehouse acceptance is recorded separately by `finished_product_receipts` for the same `production_identity_id`.

| Field                                                            | Why it exists                                                                   | Optional / challenge later                                      |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `lot_quality_record_id`                                          | Technical identifier for the Quality stage record.                              | No.                                                             |
| `production_identity_id`                                         | Connects Quality to the Warehouse-defined lot history.                          | No; multiple Quality records may belong to the same lot, but only one may carry the send marker. |
| `business_date`, `shift_code`                                    | Operational time of the inspection.                                             | No.                                                             |
| `inspected_by_user_id`, `supervisor_user_id`                     | Quality responsibility and supervision.                                         | No.                                                             |
| `visual_defect_categories`, `internal_defect_categories`         | Defects reported by Quality before handoff.                                     | Yes as text for now; normalize only after categories stabilize. |
| `quality_state`                                                  | Operation quality state at handoff: standard, special nomenclature, or flagged. | No.                                                             |
| `special_nomenclature`                                           | Policy-specific nomenclature assigned by Quality.                               | Yes.                                                            |
| `delivery_condition_note`                                        | Conditions reported to Warehouse.                                               | Yes.                                                            |
| `quality_sent_to_warehouse_at`, `quality_sent_to_warehouse_by_user_id` | Exact time and Quality actor for the one permitted send to Warehouse. | Yes; `quality_sent_to_warehouse_at` is the explicit send marker. PostgreSQL enforces at most one non-null marker per `production_identity_id` with the documented partial unique index; `business_date` remains the UI-facing operational date. |
| `warehouse_note`, `noted_by_user_id`, `warehouse_noted_at`        | Brief Warehouse coordination note, actor, and time on the singular sent handoff before a Warehouse receipt exists for the same `production_identity_id`. The note does not mean acceptance, create a resend, or change identity; the actor is an audit fact, not a permission source. | Yes; allowed only while that singular handoff is pending. |
| `notes`                                                          | Optional quality context.                                                       | Yes.                                                            |
| `created_at`, `updated_at`                                       | System capture and last update timestamps.                                      | Created no; updated yes.                                        |

### `batch_processing_record_corrections`

Represents audit history for controlled edits to Batch Processing records.

| Field                                  | Why it exists                                                  | Optional / challenge later                       |
| -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `correction_id`                        | Technical identifier for the audit entry.                      | No.                                              |
| `record_table`, `record_id`            | Identifies the corrected current business record.              | No; polymorphic by design to keep audit minimal. |
| `corrected_by_user_id`, `corrected_at` | Who corrected the record and when the correction was captured. | No.                                              |
| `correction_reason`                    | Required business reason for the correction.                   | No.                                              |
| `authorization_basis`                  | Operational window, SysAdmin override, or other policy basis.  | Yes but recommended.                             |
| `before_values`, `after_values`        | Full before/after evidence.                                    | No.                                              |
| `created_at`                           | System timestamp for the audit row.                            | No.                                              |
