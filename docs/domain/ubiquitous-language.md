# Ubiquitous Language — Naming Contract

This document defines the **canonical English naming contract** for architecture, code, APIs, database design, and cross-team technical discussions.

It is intentionally **small and stable**. It does **not** try to translate every business term in the system. It only covers terms that are easy to mistranslate, easy to overload, or likely to cause bad code names.

---

## Scope

Use this document when naming:

- bounded contexts and modules
- entities, value objects, enums, and state fields
- API contracts and DTOs
- database tables and columns
- frontend feature areas and technical artifacts

If a term is not listed here, keep the nearest existing architecture/PRD wording unless a later naming decision explicitly replaces it.

This document is a **naming contract only**. It does **not** define:

- bounded-context ownership
- lifecycle timing
- persistence strategy
- internal identifier strategy
- workflow state rules

## Canonical terms

| Spanish term                            | Business meaning                                                                       | Canonical English term for docs          | Canonical code term                   | Avoid / notes                                                                                                                   |
| --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `fardo`                                 | Raw-material unit received from suppliers before any production lot exists             | **bale**                                 | `bale`                                | Avoid `bundle` or `lot`. A `fardo` is not a production lot.                                                                     |
| `título`                                | Textile count/thickness designation of the yarn, such as `2/18` or `2/32`              | **yarn count**                           | `yarnCount`                           | Avoid bare `title`; it is overloaded in software and weak in English. Keep `title` only when quoting legacy business wording.   |
| `lote`                                  | Physical batch tracked through Lot Processing and later Warehouse continuity           | **lot**                                  | `lot`                                 | Use only for the physical batch, not for upstream raw-material reception.                                                       |
| `identidad de producción`               | Business identity used across contexts before and during production flow               | **production identity**                  | `productionIdentity`                  | Keep distinct from `lot`.                                                                                                       |
| `código de lote`                        | Visible shared identifier used by business users to track a lot                        | **lot code**                             | `lotCode`                             | Visible business code only. Technical identifier rules belong in persistence docs.                                              |
| `madeja`                                | Skein output from Madejeras and input to lot assembly                                  | **skein**                                | `skein`                               | Avoid leaving `madeja` in new code unless integrating with external/local terminology that must stay Spanish.                   |
| `devanado`                              | Conversion of skeins into cones for the industrial format                              | **winding**                              | `winding`                             | Avoid translating both `devanado` and `ovillado` as `winding`; they are different stages/variants.                              |
| `ovillado`                              | Conversion of skeins into yarn balls for direct-sale format                            | **ball winding**                         | `balling`                             | Avoid generic `winding`. Use a distinct term because it produces balls, not cones.                                              |
| `embolsado`                             | Bagging/packing stage after winding or balling                                         | **bagging**                              | `bagging`                             | Avoid `packaging` for the stage name unless talking about the broader packaging domain.                                         |
| `avance`                                | Section-level summary record of inputs, outputs, and flow in Yarn Spinning             | **progress record**                      | `progress`                            | Avoid the false friend `advance` in code. Use `progress` for the record family.                                                 |
| `descarga`                              | One machine-level production output event within a shift                               | **production discharge**                 | `discharge`                           | Avoid `download`, `unload`, or `shipment`. In this domain it is a production event.                                             |
| `desperdicio`                           | Material loss or discard recorded by context/stage                                     | **waste**                                | `waste`                               | Use qualifiers when needed: `realWaste`, `accumulatedWaste`, `theoreticalWaste`.                                                |
| `observado`                             | Product or lot with documented issues that require review or conditional handling      | **flagged**                              | `flagged`                             | Avoid literal `observed`; in code, qualify if needed (`flaggedLot`, `flaggedProduct`).                                          |
| `defectuoso`                            | Product classified as significantly defective in Warehouse handling                    | **defective**                            | `defective`                           | Keep separate from `waste`; in code, qualify if needed (`defectiveLot`, `defectiveProduct`).                                   |
| `disponibilidad`                        | Warehouse readiness for use, distribution, or release                                  | **availability state**                   | `availabilityState`                   | Do not use this as a synonym for stock quantity. In code, prefer qualified names such as `lotAvailabilityState`, `productAvailabilityState`, or `warehouseAvailabilityState` when ambiguity is possible. |
| `presentación`                          | Physical form in which PT is stored or handled, such as bagged/bulk or cone/ball form  | **physical presentation**                | `physicalPresentation`                | Prefer `physicalPresentation` in code and schemas; avoid generic `presentation`.                                                |
| `Inventario` (rol / etapa en Operación) | Operational role and first stage in Lot Processing where the physical lot is assembled | **Inventory stage / Inventory operator** | `inventoryStage`, `inventoryOperator` | Never use bare `inventory` to mean Warehouse stock in the same model.                                                           |
| `inventario` / `existencias` (Almacén)  | Warehouse stock, balances, and custody quantities                                      | **stock**                                | `stock`                               | Prefer `stock` for Warehouse quantities. Reserve `inventory` for the Operation role/stage or clearly qualified technical names. |

## Canonical section and stage names

Use these names for **operation section/stage identifiers** so process names stay stable across docs, code, APIs, and tables.

| Spanish name in business docs   | Scope                                                              | Canonical English name for docs | Canonical code term | Avoid / notes                                                                                                                                                  |

Keep `Bobinados` visible in docs when referring to the plant section name.                           |
| `Retorcido`                     | Yarn Spinning section                                              | **Twisting**                    | `twisting`          | Avoid `twisted` as a stage name.                                                                                                                               |

Use `skeining` in code.                                                               |

If a very local enum already sits inside Lot Processing, `inventory` is acceptable only when no stock collision exists. |

Do not reuse `winding` for `Bobinados`.                                                                |

## Intentional distinctions

### Yarn count vs title

- In business conversations, people may still say **título**.
- In technical English artifacts, prefer **yarn count**.
- In code, prefer `yarnCount`.

### Inventory vs stock

- In **Lot Processing**, `inventoryStage` and `inventoryOperator` are valid.
- In **Warehouse**, balances and custody should prefer **stock** terminology.

This is a hard rule to avoid one of the worst naming collisions in the current docs.

### Availability state vs stock

- **availabilityState** = Warehouse operational readiness for release or distribution.
- **stock** = Warehouse quantities and balances.

Do not use `availability` as a synonym for `stock`.

### Process quality vs lot quality

- **processQuality** = quality control during the process, usually by section or machine.
- **lotQuality** = final quality evaluation of the lot before handoff to Warehouse.

They are not interchangeable and should not share one generic code term.

### Stage names vs action names

When a process term can mean both a **stage/section** and an **action**, keep
the naming roles separate:

- use the **noun form** for the stage or section name
- use the **verb form** for the command/use case name
- use a **result/state form** only when a resulting condition must be modeled explicitly

Examples:

- `bagging` = stage, `bagLot` = action, `bagged` = result/state when needed
- `winding` = stage, `windLot` = action
- `dyeing` = stage, `dyeLot` = action
- `drying` = stage, `dryLot` = action

This prevents one term from carrying section, command, and status meanings at the same time.

---

## How to use this contract

### Architecture

- Use the **canonical English term for docs** in architecture narratives.
- When a distinction is boundary-critical, prefer the fuller phrase even if code stays shorter.

### Backend

- Use the **canonical code term** for entities, fields, enums, ports, repositories, and module-internal names.
- If a field lives in a broad/shared schema or the term is too generic on its own, qualify it with its domain meaning instead of inventing a synonym.

### Frontend

- Use the same code terms for feature modules, API clients, and state models.
- UI copy may follow business wording, but internal model names should still follow this contract.

### Database

- Prefer stable noun-based names from the **canonical code term** column.
- Do not encode Spanish synonyms and English synonyms for the same concept in different tables or columns.
- When a canonical term is too broad on its own, qualify it by domain meaning instead of using a vague short form.

---

## Non-goals

- This is not a full business glossary.
- This does not replace the PRDs.
- This does not redefine bounded-context ownership.
- This does not define technical IDs, database references, or persistence rules.

It only stabilizes naming so later design and implementation stop drifting.
